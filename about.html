    <h1>About ADNUG</h1>

    <p>The Adelaide .NET User Group can trace its origins way back to 1993 when it started out as the SA branch of the Australian Visual Basic Users Group.</p>
        
    <p>In 2001 as Microsoft were about to release the very first version of .NET, it changed to become the Adelaide .NET User Group (ADNUG).</p>

    <h2>Leadership</h2>
    <p>Peter Griffith, Dan Drake-Brockman and Sorin Buzila were the original organising committee for the group. In later years,
        Peter was doing most of the meeting organisation (as well as initiating Adelaide Code Camps and the very first DDD Adelaide events)
    <p>In August 2014, <a href="https://david.gardiner.net.au">David Gardiner</a> stepped up to take over the running of the group.</p>
    <p>Impressively, Peter is still a regular attendee!</p>
